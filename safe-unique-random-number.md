## Safe random number by using PI magical number: 
imagine the infinite number have many position not-iterate. how to use this number for generating random number?\
guess number position, then pick the number on that position.\
example: number 1\
- first position in array 3.1415.... is 0
- next position of 1 is 2
- next position is 36
- and next is 39

So we have(generated) random number by position of number **"1"**, and never iterating the random number, thuse unique was generated number...

```
Pi = 3.1415926535 8979323846 2643383279 5028841971 6939937510 5820974944 5923078164 0628620899 8628034825 3421170679 ...
```
