## Safe random number by using PI magical number: 
imagine the infinite number have many position not-iterate. how to use this number for generating random number?\
guess number position, then pick the number on that position.

example: number 1
- first position in array 3.1415.... is 0 after the .(digits)
- next position of 1 is 2
- next position is 36
- and next is 39

So we have(generated) random number by position of number **"1"**, and never iterating the random number, thuse unique was generated number...

```
Pi = 3.1415926535 8979323846 2643383279 5028841971 6939937510 5820974944 5923078164 0628620899 8628034825 3421170679 ...
```

this equation always is : O(log n)

## now more complex equation:
imagine you choosing the number "1"\
position is 0, 1+0 = 1\
next search for 1, position is 2, so 1+2=3\
now search for 3 from the first position, is 8 position. 3+8 = 11, 11 is 1+1=2\
now search for next position after the position generated by 3 (is 11), so there is two way:
- 11 + 2 = 13, we search next position from 13 and the number is 9
- or position 11 (1+1=2) search for next 2 from the position 11, we founded number is position 15 (number 2)

now we can make our algorithm for searching and find next random number.\
at the end we have the unique pattern for generating magic number.

#

#### only thing you need to create more complex equation is:
shuffle some random, choose 1 of them by the basic pattern and reveal the unique one of them !\
example: we generate 3 position of number 2,6&4. then choose position 0 || 1 || 2 for this 3 position and reveal the current position of that.\
example pesudo code:
```
2 = position x
6 = position y
4 = position z
R = [x,y,z]
A = random(R)
// reveal A (example is x, position 0, value of real position is 5)
output: "position 2 = x =>" random number is 5
```

#### behind history of this code
i make this pattern and used this pattern many years ago in a lottery/bet platform used #erlang and #python, but i make/made a unique algorithm to use.\
i just reveal this pattern for fun in the github community of programmers. enjoy it! and remember to give me my "**nobel prize**" :)

#### an advice to the next generation of programmers:
ai never can make the new creative algorithms from real nature. looking around the world, like earth & tree, stars and oceans. you can find a chaos algorithm of fractals and Pi number. the ai never can experience this world like us! so be yourself and grow...
