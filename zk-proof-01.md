### Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)
Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is an encryption scheme that allows for proving the authenticity of a statement without revealing any additional information beyond what is necessary for the proof. [ [ref-1] ](https://github.com/mosi-arch/documents/edit/main/zk-proof-01.md#references)\
Here's a simple example of a ZKP algorithm in pseudocode:

```js
// Prover wants to prove knowledge of a secret value x in a range [1, N]
// Verifier wants to verify the proof without learning anything about x

// Prover:
x = random value in [1, N]
r = random value
h = hash(x, r) // hash function
y = x + r

// Send (h, y) to verifier

// Verifier:
h, y = receive from prover
assert y > 0 and y <= N + h_max // h_max is the maximum value of h that is allowed
assert hash(x, y - x) == h // check that (h, y) is a valid proof for x

// Done!
```

This is a simple example of a ZKP algorithm called a "discrete logarithm proof" that proves knowledge of a secret value x in a `range [1, N]` without revealing x.\
The idea is that the prover selects a random value r, computes y = x + r, and sends the verifier the hash of x and r (h) and y.\
The verifier checks that `y` is in the `range [1, N + h_max]` and that the hash of `x and y - x equals h`, which proves that the prover knows `x` without revealing it.\
There are many other types of ZKP algorithms with different properties and use cases, but they all rely on similar principles. [ [ref-1] ](https://github.com/mosi-arch/documents/edit/main/zk-proof-01.md#references)

#### Example usecase:
- Authentication
- Anonymous transaction
- Messaging | Share data
- Protecting the storage or Sensitive data
- Profitable search time from "T=O(n)" to "T=O(1)=1"
