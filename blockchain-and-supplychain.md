## How to blockchain make easy life by combination with supply chain and insurance

#### Here is a pseudocode for how incoterms rules in blockchain can make a better world and help solve supply chain problems:

- Define the problem: Supply chain logistics is often fragmented and inefficient, leading to delays, disputes, and increased costs for businesses and consumers.

- Identify the solution: By incorporating incoterms rules into a blockchain-based supply chain system, businesses can streamline logistics processes and reduce the risk of errors and disputes.

- Develop the system: Create a blockchain-based platform that incorporates incoterms rules into the supply chain process. This system should allow for the secure sharing of information between all parties involved in the supply chain, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers.

- Implement the system: Encourage businesses to adopt the new system by highlighting its benefits, such as increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved transparency.

- Evaluate the results: Monitor the impact of the new system on supply chain logistics, tracking key metrics such as delivery times, error rates, and costs. Use this data to make further improvements and refine the system over time.

By combining incoterms rules with blockchain technology, we can create a more efficient, transparent, and secure supply chain system that benefits businesses and consumers alike.

#### here's an example code of Solidity using **"FOB"** incoterms rule:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FOBContract {

    // Define the parties involved in the transaction
    address buyer;
    address seller;
    address carrier;

    // Define the terms of the contract
    string public terms = "FOB";

    // Define the price of the goods
    uint256 public price;

    // Define the location of the goods
    string public location;

    // Define the delivery date of the goods
    uint256 public deliveryDate;

    // Define the payment terms
    string public paymentTerms;

    // Define the constructor function
    constructor(
        address _buyer, 
        address _seller, 
        address _carrier, 
        uint256 _price, 
        string memory _location, 
        uint256 _deliveryDate, 
        string memory _paymentTerms
    ) public {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        carrier = _carrier;
        price = _price;
        location = _location;
        deliveryDate = _deliveryDate;
        paymentTerms = _paymentTerms;
    }

    // Define the transfer of ownership function
    function transferOwnership() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer);
        // Transfer ownership of the goods to the buyer
    }

    // Define the payment function
    function makePayment() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer);
        require(msg.value == price);
        // Release payment to the seller
    }

    // Define the delivery function
    function confirmDelivery() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer);
        // Confirm delivery of the goods to the buyer
    }

    // Define the dispute resolution function
    function resolveDispute() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == carrier);
        // Resolve any disputes that may arise during the transaction
    }
}
```

> "solidity logic prototype code"

In this example, we have created a Solidity contract that uses the **"FOB"** incoterms rule. The contract includes the parties involved in the transaction, the terms of the contract, the price of the goods, the location of the goods, the delivery date, and the payment terms. The contract also includes functions for transferring ownership, making payments, confirming delivery, and resolving disputes. By using Solidity and blockchain technology, we can create a more efficient and secure supply chain system that benefits all parties involved in the transaction.

The seven Incoterms® 2020 rules for any mode(s) of transport are: 
- EXW - Ex Works (insert place of delivery)
- FCA  - Free Carrier (Insert named place of delivery) 
- CPT  - Carriage Paid to (insert place of destination) 
- CIP -  Carriage and Insurance Paid To (insert place of destination)  
- DAP - Delivered at Place (insert named place of destination)  
- DPU - Delivered at Place Unloaded (insert of place of destination)  
- DDP - Delivered Duty Paid (Insert place of destination).  
Note: the DPU Incoterms replaces the old DAT, with additional requirements for the seller to unload the goods from the arriving means of transport. 

The four Incoterms® 2020 rules for Sea and Inland Waterway Transport are: 
- FAS - Free Alongside Ship (insert name of port of loading) 
- FOB - Free on Board (insert named port of loading) 
- CFR - Cost and Freight (insert named port of destination) 
- CIF -  Cost Insurance and Freight (insert named port of destination)
