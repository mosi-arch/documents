# documents
Documents "about my research" i made for social media, about blockchain & web3.\
Notice: codes in theses documents are just for example and showcase purposes.\
Validation: some of these documents are under the "proof of concept" [[read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept)].

There is just one rule, (no rule...)
> No need you are be outside the box, break the old useless rules of coding, change mindset and make new era of coding.
