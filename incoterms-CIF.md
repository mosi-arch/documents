Here's an example Solidity code that uses "CIF" incoterms rule for a hypothetical international trade contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; 
contract InternationalTradeContract { 
  // Enum to define the different incoterms rules 
  enum Incoterms { 
    FOB, FAS, CFR, CIF 
  } 

  // Struct to represent the contract terms 
  struct ContractTerms { 
    uint256 price; 
    // Price of goods 
    uint256 quantity; 
    // Quantity of goods 
    Incoterms incoterms; 
    // Incoterms rule used 
    string portOfLoading; 
    // Port of loading 
    string portOfDestination; 
    // Port of destination 
  } 

  // Function to calculate the total cost of the trade based on the incoterms rule 
  function calculateTotalCost(ContractTerms memory contractTerms) public view returns (uint256) { 
    uint256 totalCost; 
    if (contractTerms.incoterms == Incoterms.CIF) { 
      // CIF: Seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the port of shipment and loading them onto the shipping vessel. Seller also pays for the shipping costs and insurance costs up to the port of destination. Seller is also responsible for obtaining the necessary documents for export and paying for any inspections required by the importing country. Buyer is responsible for paying for the goods and all other costs and risks from the port of destination onwards. 
      totalCost = contractTerms.price * contractTerms.quantity; 
      // Add shipping costs and insurance costs paid by seller 
      totalCost += calculateShippingCosts(contractTerms.portOfLoading, contractTerms.portOfDestination); 
      totalCost += calculateInsuranceCosts(contractTerms.price, contractTerms.quantity); 
      // Add inspection costs and other fees paid by seller 
      totalCost += calculateInspectionCosts(); 
      totalCost += calculateOtherFees(); 
    } 
    return totalCost; 
  } 

  // Helper function to calculate shipping costs 
  function calculateShippingCosts(string memory portOfLoading, string memory portOfDestination) private pure returns (uint256) { 
    // Calculate shipping costs based on the distance between the two ports 
    uint256 distance = calculateDistanceBetweenPorts(portOfLoading, portOfDestination); 
    uint256 shippingCosts = distance * 100; 
    // Assuming a fixed rate of $100 per unit of distance 
    return shippingCosts; 
  } 

  // Helper function to calculate insurance costs 
  function calculateInsuranceCosts(uint256 price, uint256 quantity) private pure returns (uint256) { 
    uint256 insuranceCosts = (price * quantity * 2) / 1000; 
    // Assuming a rate of 0.2% of the total price of the goods 
    return insuranceCosts; 
  } 

  // Helper function to calculate inspection costs 
  function calculateInspectionCosts() private pure returns (uint256) { 
    uint256 inspectionCosts = 500; 
    // Assuming a fixed inspection cost of $500 
    return inspectionCosts; 
  } 

  // Helper function to calculate other fees 
  function calculateOtherFees() private pure returns (uint256) { 
    uint256 otherFees = 200; 
    // Assuming a fixed cost of $200 for other fees 
    return otherFees; 
  } 

  // Helper function to calculate the distance between two ports 
  function calculateDistanceBetweenPorts(string memory port1, string memory port2) private pure returns (uint256) { 
    // Implementation details not provided in this example 
    // Could use an external API or a pre-populated mapping of port distances 
    // For simplicity, assume a fixed distance of 1000 units 
    return 1000; 
  } 
}
```
